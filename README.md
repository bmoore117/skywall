# SkyWall Install Guide
This install assumes you have configured powershell to allow unsigned script execution.

If you haven't done that yet, I recommend running Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Then run enableAll.cmd

Then run createUser.ps1

VERY IMPORTANT - then change to the newly created user, skywall. You may need to do the Set-ExecutionPolicy thing again.

Then run install.ps1
